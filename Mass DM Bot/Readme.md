# üì¨ Instagram Mass DM Bot (Followers Only)

This bot allows you to automatically send multiple messages to your own Instagram followers using Python and Selenium.

It logs in to your Instagram account, reads a list of usernames from a file named after your own username, and sends direct messages to the followers you specify. You can also define the number of times each message should be sent.

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Text File with Your Username

- You must create a file with the **same name as the Instagram username you will log in with**.
- Inside that file:
  - First line: **Your own username**
  - Following lines: **Usernames of the followers** you want to send messages to

üìå Example: If your Instagram username is `Ravi.txt`, then create a file named:
```
Ravi.txt
```

And inside that file, add:
```
user1_follower
user2_follower
user3_follower
```

> The bot will use this file to know who to message.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup `config.ini` File

Create or edit the `config.ini` file to include the following information:

```ini
[login]
username = your_instagram_username
password = your_instagram_password

[message]
text = Hey! Just reaching out. Hope you're doing great!

[Number of Messages you wanna send]
count = 3
```

üßæ What each field means:
- `username`: Your Instagram login username
- `password`: Your Instagram login password
- `text`: The message you want to send
- `count`: How many times the message should be sent to each user

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share your config.ini file publicly. It contains sensitive login info.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Requirements

Make sure Python is installed, then install Selenium:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Also download the correct **ChromeDriver** based on your Chrome browser version:  
üëâ https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads  
Place it in the same folder as your script or in your system path.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will:
- Open Chrome
- Log in to your Instagram account
- Read usernames from your username file
- Send your message to each user in that list the number of times specified in `config.ini`
